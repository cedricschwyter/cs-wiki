# context switch

Description: Given a computation unit (CPU), a context switch denotes the action of switching the unit from one computation to another. Typically refers to switching between processes, but can also refer to switching between threads. Depending on the size of the context ("large" for a process, "small" for thread), a context switch might be computationally expensive, i.e. require comparably much CPU time.
