# lock

Description: In general, a token/resource that can be acquired by at most one thread at a time. Locks are typically provided by a programming language to enforce mutual exclusion, by guarding/protecting a critical section. A lock can be acquired/locked by a thread, and is then held until it is released/unlocked. In Java, each object can be used as a lock (intrinsic/monitor lock), but the JDK also provides more complex locks.
