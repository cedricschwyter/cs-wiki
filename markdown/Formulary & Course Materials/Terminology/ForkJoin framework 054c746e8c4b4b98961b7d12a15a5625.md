# ForkJoin framework

Description: Introduced in Java 7, this framework embraces divide and conquer parallelism. Tasks can be spawned (forked) and joined by the framework. The ForkJoin framework automatically automatically assigns these tasks (lightweight) to Java threads (heavyweight) and may also execute multiple tasks in one thread to avoid thread context switching overhead.
