# vectorisation

Description: Using special machine code instructions to execute a single operation (e.g. plus) on a chunk of data (e.g. an array segment). Can significantly improve performance. Code can be vectorised automatically, by compilers, or manually, by using intrinsics libraries provided by hardware vendors.
