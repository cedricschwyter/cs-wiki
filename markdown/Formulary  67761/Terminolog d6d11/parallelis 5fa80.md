# parallelism

Description: Doing mupltiple things at the same time (as opposed to concurrency: dealing with multiple things at the same time). Performing computations simultaneously; either actually, if sufficient computations units (CPUs, cores, ...) are available, or virtually, via some form of alternation. Often used interchangeably with concurrency. Parallelism can be specified explicitely by manually assigning tasks to threads or implicitely by using a framework that takes care of distributing tasks to threads.
