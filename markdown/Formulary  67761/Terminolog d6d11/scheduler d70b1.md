# scheduler

Description: A management process, e.g. on the operating system level, that performs context switches. I.e. it interrupts/pauses/sends to sleep the currently running process (or thread), performs a context switch, and selects the next process (or thread) to run. Schedulers typically do not give guarantees when and how often they act, who gets selected next, etc.
